There are 'N' students standing in a line, and their heights are given.
But the constraint is that the difference in heights of adjacent students does not exceed 'K', i.e.,

| height[i] - height[i+1] | <= K, where i âˆˆ  (1, N-1)

Your task is to find the position of a student having height 'H'. If no such student is found, return -1.

Positions are counted starting from 0.
If two or more students have height equal to 'H', return the student with the minimum position.
